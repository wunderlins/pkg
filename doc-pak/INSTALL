INSTALLATION

You need a C++ compiler (for example g++) and make (eg. cmake). This programm is intended to be used on systems with gnu or bsd userland tools. However, bsd support is largely untested for now.

To compile the project, cd into the source code directory and run make:
$ make

This will generate a file `pk` in your source code directory. You might move this file to any location in your $PATH. Alternatively just use `make install` to have it installed to "/usr/bin/pk".

# make install # as root

Now you should be able to use upkg (or /usr/bin/pk if the folder is not in your $PATH variable).

For additional targets check the Makefile, notable targets:
	debug         unstripped, unoptimized, -DUPKG_DEBUG=1 (verbous)
	dev|debug2    unstripped, unoptimized, -DUPKG_DEBUG=1 (verbous)
	docu          create documentation (CHANGELOG vom svn and TODO)
	              works only on subversion checkouts.
	deb           create debian package with checkinstall
	clean         cleanup after compilation, removes generated files
